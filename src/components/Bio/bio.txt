Background

Hi, I am a research scientist and data analyst from the southeastern United States. After 8 years collecting data in the field, I began studying how to best manage, analyze, and visualize these data. Over the past three years, I have produce numerous data cleaning and management utilities, visualizations, and statistical notebooks at work and for my personal projects.

Outside my life on the internet, I am passionate about field geology, volcanoes, and science outreach. I have been lucky to spend well over 2,000 hours performing geological field research in northern Manitoba, the western United States---Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming---and soon I will add New Zealand to this list!

Opportunities

I am in the market for part-time and full-time opportunities in the data space. I offer expertise in modernizing data collection and management, designing static and interactive visualizations, and developing statistical notebooks for routine analysis.

If you are an environmental NGO, I am always happy to volunteer my time producing dashboards, data visualizations, and data management solutions. Please reach out. I'd love to hear from you!
